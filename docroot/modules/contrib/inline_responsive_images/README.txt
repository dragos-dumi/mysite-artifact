DESCRIPTION
-----------
It's not great for the authoring experience nor for structured content reasons
that users are defining the specific dimensions of every single image they insert.
It would be much better to allow them to choose from image styles, just like we do for image fields.
This module lets users select a responsive style OR an image style to place images in the content.

This module is essentially a stand alone version of the patch in this issue:
https://www.drupal.org/node/2061377
When that patch makes it in into core, this module is no longer needed.
    
REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires the following modules:

 * Responsive Images (https://www.drupal.org/project/responsive_images)


INSTALLATION
------------
1. Extract the tar.gz into your 'modules' directory.
2. Enable the module at 'administer/modules'.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
 * The module has no menu or modifiable settings.

 * Enable the text format filter 'Display responsive images' or 'Display image styles' and select the images styles/responsive styles
   that you want to be available to the user.

 * When the module is enabled, create new content. In the editor, click on the image icon in the toolbar. A popup will open where the
   user can upload an image and assign an image style or responsive style by selecting style from the dropdown menu.
