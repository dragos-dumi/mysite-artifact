Raven Sentry client
===================

Raven module is a Drupal client for [Sentry](https://getsentry.com/), an open
source exception logging, aggregation and notification platform.

This module allows your Drupal site to send errors, warnings and notices to a
Sentry server, including fatal PHP and JavaScript errors that typically are not
logged by Drupal.

## Installation for Drupal 8

If your site was built from drupal-composer/drupal-project, run
`composer require drupal/raven` to install this module and its dependencies.

If you are using Composer Manager (deprecated), run `composer drupal-update` at
the top level of your Drupal site.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are defined in the composer.json file.
