/* DESCRIPTION */

Views Accordion provides a display style plugin for the Views module.

1. Place the views_accordion module in your modules directory (usually under /modules/).
2. Go to /admin/modules, and activate the module.


/* USING VIEWS ACCORDION MODULE */

Your view must meet the following requirements:
  * Row style must be set to Fields
  * Provide at least two fields to show.

Choose Views Accordion in the Style dialog within your view, which will prompt you to configure the jquery.ui.accorion settings.

The first field WILL be used as the header for each accordion section, all others will be displayed
when the header is clicked. The module creates an accordion section per row of results from the view.
